# Overview
In this game, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the ship to the right and left using appropriate arrow keys and shoot a limited number of bullets using the spacebar at the alien ships that appear at the top and move across and down the screen. If all alien ships are destroyed, a new fleet appears. Otherwise, the player loses a ship.  

# Challenges
The biggest challenge for making the game was making sure all of the functionalities worked together seamlessly. 

# Future improvements
There are a couple of things I want to improve in this project. The first is to polish the look of the game. Background and alien ships are primary candidates for this. The second is to add sound features, so that the game will be more realistic and enjoyable. The third and last one is to have a scoring system so that the game will have challenges.
